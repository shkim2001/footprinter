# Footprinter

This is an online solution for calculating environmental footprints of organizations. It asks the users a multiple questions about their organizations and then use this input to calculate the total environmental footprint. Solutions for improving the organization's footprints would also be recommended based on the obtained result and the characteristics of the organization. 

Due to limited time, our team couldn't upload a completed website. But we used Adobe XD to prototype the website and show how the features would be added. 

To analyze data and recommend the best solution, we planned to use Google Cloud services and/or Jina. Firstly, we propose utilizing Google Cloud's Document AI and Jina's neural search to extract the key words from the problematic part (e.g. Electricity, Wood) and search helpful online resources and provide the links for the companies. It might be a good starting point or a guideline to get access to various resources. Secondly, we propose training a machine learning model with Google's VertexAI to cluster companies and figure out the most effective solution each group took. Because of limited time, we couldn't actually put them into practice but they will certainly be great areas of development for this project to improve user experience.
